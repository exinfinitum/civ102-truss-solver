This is a truss bridge solver designed to facilitate tedious, error-prone and infuriatingly long bridge calculations.
It will calculate the stress on each member, as well as the smallest HSS size (out of the list of HSS types provided by Professor
Michael Collins, lecturer of CIV102) needed for a safe design.

You will need to edit the code yourself to suit your bridge's geometry, though.
